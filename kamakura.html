			Was a rival of Kyoto in terms of political, economic, and cultural power before, Now Kamakura is largely known for its plentiness of temples &amp; shrines, with a special giant buddha statue <span class="bold">(鎌倉大仏 - Kamakura daibutsu)</span>, and a big Shinto Shrine <span class="bold">(鶴岡八幡宮 - Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu)</span>. Other than that, Kamakura has a quite beautiful beach called <span class="bold">Yuigahama Beach (由比ヶ浜海岸)</span>, and a small offshore island called <span class="bold">Enoshima (江ノ島)</span>.<br><br>

					KOMACHI STREET

		</div>

		<p class="content en">
			<span class="bold">Komachi Street</span> is a small road that connects Kamakura Station to Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine. Because of its convenience, Komachi Street quickly becomes a tourist attraction. <br><br>

			The main attraction for that streets, is a heavenly thing we call <span class="bold">DESSERTS.</span><br>AND YES. I DON'T HAVE ANY PHOTO OF THEM BECAUSE I CAN'T GET DESSERT TO THE TOP OF MY PRIORITY TO HAVE MY MONEY SPENT FOR IT. No matter how much do I want them. I'll post the photos of those mouthwatering desserts once I have the money to buy them.<br>
			I think I'm okay to spend 3000円+ (~IDR 360k) just to savour everything I want there.<br><br>

			What do they sell? Lots of pancakes. from waffles, fish-shaped pancake, and usual pancakes. Others" Cakes, Ice Creams (omg), Kamakura Sausage. Other than that, usual Japanese cuisines are also there. However, its snacks and desserts which makes this street full-packed with people.<br><br>

			Yes, for everyone who loves desserts, this place is a heaven. The only thing which makes this place is not as heavenly is: the street is soo crowded which makes queueing, or even just walking around, difficult. Thankfully in here, crowded does not equal to chaos. Everything is still in order. So yeah, a super recommended place to go to, especially that after you go through this street, the second point of interest is waiting: Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine.

			<span class="bold">Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu (鶴岡八幡宮)</span> is a big Shinto Shrine located at the center of the city, which the main access is from Kamakura's main street (header's picture), or from Komachi Street.<br><br>

			Super big. 1.8km<sup>2</sup> (Wikipedia), lots of museums, lots of buildings, ponds, and most importantly, is surrounded by beautiful trees and plants. It is used to host important festivals, and holds a great cultural value for Kamakura City.<br><br>

			As usual, there's a Torii (IDN: gapura (?)) at the front gate of the Shrine. After that, there's a field where snack stalls welcome us. Behind the field, there's a sub-shrine. When I came, there's a marriage ceremony commencing there. Quite interesting! After that, there's a big staircase which leads to the real shrine.<br><br>

			I didn't spend more than 5 minute at the shrine itself - nothing to be seen except people throwing coins to a place (tradition?).Or I'm missing something? I don't know. My friend said that we can take a fortune telling service for the cost of 100円 there.<br><br>Instead, I ventured around the complex and saw lots of beautiful trees, which leaves are turning red, due to the autumn season here. Small shrines, ponds full of doves, small rivers, everywhere is surrounded by beauty. For the doves, I saw lots of locals bring bird foods to attract them. It's exciting to be surrounded by doves, except when they start to overwhelm you by their numbers. lol.<br><br>

			I ended my strolling there by buying a portion of roasted chicken skin (500円). Its delicious! A local beside me repeatedly said "Mmm! Oishii (Delicious)!". After that, I bought a grape candy stick - a grape (or apple) coated by grape (or apple)-taste candy coating (100円 for 1, 150円 for 2).<br><br>

			Below are some pictures I took (I can't put too many here or this page will eat your data plan). <a href="#content">Skip Photos</a><br><br>
