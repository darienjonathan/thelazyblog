# thelazyblog - what is this?

This is a pseudo-blog before the real blog comes out.

Why "thelazyblog"? Since this blog comes out of my laziness, procrastinating too much to study the **MEAN** platform (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) which means the blog won't up soon if I didn't decide to do it the lazy way.

This is really lazy - consists of only **HTML** and **CSS**, and most of the designs are made out of **Foundation 6**.
But I hope I'm not lazy enough to update the contents of this blog. Enjoy!
