		<h1>Free Will?</h1>
		<p class="lead">Situation</p>
		<p class="content">
			Yesterday (Fri, 26/8/2016), I came to UI to congratulate my friend who are graduated (congrats guys! See you on top!). After that, I have to rush myself to church (18.15 from Depok, 20.00 at church). With a motorcycle, UI - Church (Depok - Kalideres) takes approximately 100 minutes in normal traffic and normal route. However, on a Friday evening, Jakarta's traffic is, obviously, not "normal".<br>

			So I took an extensive look at Google Maps before driving, then I gave a verdict that:
			<ul><li>My usual route, TB Simatupang - Jalan Panjang - Puri, was not passable. MRT construction screws TB Simatupang hard 
				enough to give it a > 3KM red label in Gmaps,</li>
				<li>My 2nd usual route, Pasar Minggu - Arteri Tol Dalam Kota - Daan Mogot, was also not passable. Pasar Minggu looks bleak, Gatot Subroto is never friendly, Slipi was bloody red, and Daan Mogot sucks lately.</li></ul>

			That means, unless I try to risk myself to venture around Pejaten - Kemang - Jalan Panjang - Puri, which I have no knowledge about, I'm sure that I'll take at least 150 minutes (which means I'm gonna be a total scumbag for coming late to church for 45 minutes).<br>
		</p>
		<p class="lead">Two Decisions</p>
		<p class="content">
			<span class="bold">The First Decision:</span> Yeah. <span class="bold">Nothing's gonna stopping me from trying the Pejaten - Kemang route</span>, which looks fairly promising. In the maps, It looks that at the dreaded Pasar Minggu junction, I should just turn left, then go straight until I see Pejaten Vilage.<br>

			I did that, and I was surprised that after the junction, instead of going straight, I must turn left at the, lets say, <span class="bold">Junction A</span> (well, this is not straight bro). Then I saw <span class="bold">Junction B</span>. The logic is, if I turn left again, I would be back at Pasar Minggu (left - left - left = back). So to maintain the straight route, <span class="bold">The Second Decision: I turned right.</span><br>
		</p>
		<p class="lead">Result</p>
		<p class="content">
			And, I was woefully shocked when I saw myself BACK at Pasar Minggu street. Damn. <span class="bold underline">My decisions couldn't save me from me being a scumbag.</span><br>

			So Yeah. I drove my bike.<br>

			<span class="bold">First.</span> The Pasar Minggu street was not as bleak as I thought. The traffic jam have partly subsided since last time I looked at the maps. I passed the street without any major congestion. <span class="bold">Second.</span> Gatot Subroto was (unexpectedly) as friendly as if I am driving at 3 AM. Ez full throttle. <span class="bold">Third.</span> It was true that Slipi was bloody red. But only for car drivers. There were enough space for motorcyclist to rake their speed up to 50 kmh.<br>

			<span class="bold">Fourth.</span> Lol jk. There was no fourth. The other part of Slipi was totally jammed, so I decided to take another risk - trying to craft my way to Daan Mogot via Palmerah (something I have never tried before). Well, this time I managed to find the way. And again, Daan Mogot's traffic jam has totally subsided. In the end, I took 110 minutes - (only) 5 minutes late. <span class="bold">So, moving back to Pasar Minggu was the right thing to do.</span>

		<p class="lead">What I've Learned - Free Will?</p>
		<p class="content">
			It was my <span class="bold">free will</span> that stopped me from taking Pasming route. It was my <span class="bold">free will</span> that allowed me to take the risk. It was also my <span class="bold">free will</span> that allowed me to take the right turn at the Junction B (because of this right turn, I failed to make it to Pejaten).<br>

			I did what I wanted to, but I realize that, sometimes, I am unable to control the consequences of my decisions. I am unable to ensure that my <span class="bold">free will</span> always yields the best result. I didn't even know what were I doing with my <span class="bold">free will</span> (that wrong right turn at Junction B - I didn't realize that the roads before Junction A and after Junction B are curved, so because of that premise, my logic to turn right is entirely flawed).<br>

			<img class="content-img" src="assets/img/freewill.PNG"><br>

			My <span class="bold">free will</span> fails my own intentions (I didn't even arrive to Pejaten). But what I thought was totally wrong (taking Pasming route), actually was the right thing to do. I planned my course. I executed my course. My course fails. But it's all for my own good.<br>

			Earlier this week, my small group member asked me about <span class="bold">free will</span> from Proverbs 16:1,9<br>

			<p class="bold" style="text-align:center">
				"To humans belong the plans of the heart, but from the LORD comes the proper answer of the tongue." // "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps."
			</p>

			For me, this experience, and above verses, lays out a good answer of how <span class="bold">free will</span> works. What I learned is that:
			<ul><li>We have our own <span class="bold">free will</span>. And it is a very beautiful part of us as a human, indeed.</li>
				<li>But solely following on our own <span class="bold">free will</span> won't do any good for us, since we don't always 
				know what's good and what's bad for us. Besides, there is also God's will, which is far more superior than our own <span class="bold">free will</span>. I think, It would be quite handy if we use our own <span class="bold">free will</span> to submit ourselves to God's will.</li>
				<li>Regardless of how we use our own <span class="bold">free will</span> (even by ingoring The One who gave us <span class="bold">free will</span>), we will eventually be ended where He wants us to be, and that's the best deal we can have. Deal with that.</li></ul>

			<p class="bold" style="text-align:center">
				BUT IT IS FREAKING HARD, DON'T WE ALL AGREE?
