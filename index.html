		<h1>Free Will?</h1>
		<p class="lead">Situation</p>
		<p class="content">
			It was my <span class="bold">free will</span> that stopped me from taking Pasming route. It was my <span class="bold">free will</span> that allowed me to take the risk. It was also my <span class="bold">free will</span> that allowed me to take the right turn at the Junction B (because of this right turn, I failed to make it to Pejaten).<br>

			I did what I wanted to, but I realize that, sometimes, I am unable to control the consequences of my decisions. I am unable to ensure that my <span class="bold">free will</span> always yields the best result. I didn't even know what were I doing with my <span class="bold">free will</span> (that wrong right turn at Junction B - I didn't realize that the roads before Junction A and after Junction B are curved, so because of that premise, my logic to turn right is entirely flawed).<br>

			<img src="assets/img/freewill.PNG"><br>

			My <span class="bold">free will</span> fails my own intentions (I didn't even arrive to Pejaten). But what I thought was totally wrong (taking Pasming route), actually was the right thing to do. I planned my course. I executed my course. My course fails. But it's all for my own good.<br>

			Earlier this week, my small group member asked me about <span class="bold">free will</span> from Proverbs 16:1,9<br>

			<p class="bold" style="text-align:center">
				"To humans belong the plans of the heart, but from the LORD comes the proper answer of the tongue." // "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps."
			</p>

			For me, this experience, and above verses, lays out a good answer of how <span class="bold">free will</span> works. What I learned is that:
			<ul><li>We have our own <span class="bold">free will</span>. And it is a very beautiful part of us as a human, indeed.</li>
				<li>But solely following on our own <span class="bold">free will</span> won't do any good for us, since we don't always 
				know what's good and what's bad for us. Besides, there is also God's will, which is far more superior than our own <span class="bold">free will</span>. I think, It would be quite handy if we use our own <span class="bold">free will</span> to submit ourselves to God's will.</li>
				<li>Regardless of how we use our own <span class="bold">free will</span> (even by ingoring The One who gave us <span class="bold">free will</span>), we will eventually be ended where He wants us to be, and that's the best deal we can have. Deal with that.</li></ul>

			<p class="bold" style="text-align:center">
				BUT IT IS FREAKING HARD, DON'T WE ALL AGREE?

		<h1>About the creation of this blog</h1>
		<p class="lead">Why did I create this blog?</p>
		<p class="content">
			I am someone who likes to read and think (yes, I [over]think a lot). Hence, I like to pour my thoughts, and I think the best way to do it is in the form of writings. As much a I enjoy reading, I do also enjoy writing.<br>

			However, trying to tell them to my friends will be troublesome to them (why do they care to waste their time to listen to me, after all?), and social media is definitely not the place for "blog-like" posts (well, tl;dr).<br>

			I also want to learn how to use GitHub (explained later), so I think creating something in my GitHub account will do good to assist my understanding of GitHub.<br>

			So here it is. #thelazyblog.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">Why did I name this blog #thelazyblog?</p>
		<p class="content">
			I call this blog a "pseudoblog". This one serves as my temporary blog before the real one comes out. This blog comes out of my laziness, procrastinating too much to study the new and "cool" platforms which means the real blog won't be up soon if I didn't decide to do it the lazy way.<br>

			This is really lazy - consists of only very basic elements of a website, and most of the designs are made out of "ready-to-use" ingredients.<br>
		</p>
		<p class="lead">So, what about ".github.io" prefix in the domain name? Why not "darienjonathan.com"?</p>
		<p class="content">
			The ".github.io" prefix in the domain name means I hosted this page in GitHub (again, explained later).<br>

			Creating a domain with "darienjonathan.com" with its name means I need to spend my money on them. I definitely don't want to spend any rupiah on something temporary, so I created this page in my GitHub account. <br>

			Creating the account is free. Hence, creating this page is also free. Good guy GitHub.
		</p>	
		<hr>
		<p class="lead">What is GitHub mentioned earlier?</p>
		<p class="content">
			GitHub is, essentially, the leading social media for geeks (re: programming enthusiasts). It is the place to share your projects and to collaborate with others to contribute to projects hosted in GitHub.<br>

			You can put your project's files in your GitHub's repository (what is repository? <a href='https://github.com/darienjonathan/thelazyblog'>This is mine</a>), which should be explained in a readme file and be showcased with a webpage. That way, people will have a better understanding about your project. And if your project is interesting and/or useful, other people in GitHub probably will share their knowledge to contribute to your project, which will hasten the progress of your project. You can also contribute to other people's project.<br>

			From "branches" to safely and conveniently manage different features that are still in progress, ability to add comments on each changes made, discussion feature to gain feedbacks about the changes made in the branches, to the slick 'compare and review' feature before merging the branches or initiating discussions, GitHub has all we need to collaborate in a fast and efficient manner.<br>

			Though, to fully understand how to use this social media, you need to learn how to use it, and so do I. There are lots of great features in this platform and I'm still a total noob, so <a href='https://guides.github.com'>guides.github.com</a> will provide much clearer understanding on this platform.
		</p>		
		<p class="lead">This blog is made from?</p>
		<p class="content">
			Super basic ingredients: HTML, CSS, JS (just jQuery), and Foundation 6 (well, a framework, a total token of laziness).<br>

			For the real blog, I'm planning to use MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, NodeJS) to create this blog. However, I procrastinated too much so that until now I can't get clear understanding in any of them. I hope I can end this laziness soon and start to learn all of them, so my real blog can be online soon.
